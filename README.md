My name is Douglas Anthony and I have been homeschooled for most af my life.
I'm interested in programming, mathematics, swords, lore, and game design, in approximately that order.
I recently took up fencing, which has taught me a lot about honor and the "rules of engagement".
I personally believe that the most honorable thing one can do in a discussion is to be as intellectually honest as possible, at all times, above all else.
Of course, such a **state** requires requires utter freedom of thought, and thus speech.
As a matter of fact, such a high degree of _learning_ is necessary for a functioning society, and in turn, for a functioning economy, and in turn, for a functioning **politic**.
But such discipline can only come from sound _character_.
And such character comes only from the Almighty, through _faith_.
Namely, the Christian Faith, as expressed in the Nicene Creed.
But such faith can only be observed through _freedom_, and freedom is maintained by constant _learning_.
Hillsdale's Four Pillars, as they are known are somewhat unique in terms of virtues.
None of them con fully, truly exist without the others (though many people and governments have tried).
Moreover, any body, governmental or otherwise, lacking in any of them will surely fail.
As James Madison said, "Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people.
It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."  

It is interesting (and perhaps somewhat depressing) then, that it appears that our government has abandoned all of them.
Indeed, our very culture has.
To find a honorable man is a rare event, to find an honest one even rarer.
Any sense of duty we once had has been systematically corrupted in all but the most astute of individuals.
Respect is almost an afterthought, and comes only once you have <!-- dutifully played your part as a good little tape recorder, squawking back approved viewpoints. -->  

<!--
Even sadder, this is not unique to the political left.
Even Libertarians, it seems, are coming up with **approved** dogma.
There's nothing particularly wrong with doctrine&mdash;the Church has managed to do fine with it for years!&mdash;but the problems start when one expects others to blindly accept a given doctrine, as given, without proper motivation.
The Bible is, for Christians at the least, sufficient motivation for any doctrine.
But our culture extends further than that.
To use the language of CS (albeit inaccurately), Christianity goes "out of scope" before the culture does.
Because there is no set-in-stone, objective doctrine to which all of humanity adheres to, wo are forced to fall back on "Old Reliable": Observation.
Certain policies work and others don't.
For instance, it has been demonstrated to my satisfaction that a progressive income tax is ineffective at comparatively lessening the tax burden on poorer individuals.
But I could throw a stone in the state I live in (Washington) and hit three people who think differently than I do.
Is this a matter of opinion, or investigation?
I happen to believe that almost every question worth asking has an objective, ultimately knowable answer, and finding it is only a matter of sufficient investigation.
This goes for governmental policies, as well.
-->

But this opens the doors to the strange world of authoritarian democracies (or the tyranny of the mob).
And this is precisely why our Constitution exists: to keep the Federal government in check, and to provide a minimal, basic common ground on which the Several States could unite, hence our name: the United States.
It seems a lot of people never stop to even ask themselves what that name is supposed to mean.
We are not one grand American Empire, but rather, fifty distinct, unique territories (46 states and four technicalities: Pennsylvania is still a Commonwealth), unified on a basis of Liberty and self-government.
Or that was the idea, anyway.
We've come so far, but whether that has been on the up and up is yet another debate.

My love of abstraction started when I was about 12, when I discovered a truly delightful zero-player game (cellular automaton) invented by John Conway called the Game of Life.
Its rules are quite simple: every generation, each cell is either living or dead.
A given cells state in the next generation is determined by its own state and the state of some number of its neighbors

(in this case, its eight nearest neighbors).
If a living cell has two or three living neighbors, it remains living and otherwise dies.
If a dead cell has _exactly_ three living neighbors, it comes to life and otherwise remains dead

These simple rules give way to incredibly intricate and organic systems--and suddenly, abstraction strikes.

What if we tried to succinctly describe all possible _similar_ sets of rules? The most common method describes Conway's Game with the string `8: {S: 2, 3; B: 3}`, or the shorter `S23B3`.
But what if we mess with his rules? Say exactly six rules will also bring a cell to life: `S23B36`.
Say we wanted a truly chaotic colony: `SB2`.
Say we wanted a way to describe all possible "creatures" (for that is what they are called) that propel themselves across the board.

These sorts of puzzles (and their delightfully elegant solutions) are precisely why I started down the path to higher Mathematics.
I was told my whole life that mathematics stays much the same as you go on: loads of computation, often blindly following unintuitive rules with no motivation, citing arcane names such as "the law of equality" (which is really an axiom, not a law.
It's presupposed to be true).
This is simply not the case.
After Calculus, Math takes a turn much for the better.
All af a sudden, Math is about solving puzzles rather than "exercises" or "problems".
You want exercises?
Go to the gym.
You want problem?
Tell the IRS you aren't going to pay your taxes anymore.
You want puzzles?
*That* is the heart of Mathematics.
Not rote computation or endless recall, but creative, motivated *puzzling*.
Mathematicians like to play games.
Math is just another game.
A game with many minigames: Arithmetic, Calculus, fluid dynamics, set theory, group theory, "The Monster", and others.
How can we mathematically (not programmatically!) predict what a given pattern will look like, say 300 generations from now, _without_ computing the 299 generations in between? Can we generalize this to all rulesets?
